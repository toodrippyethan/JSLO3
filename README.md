# Project Overview

In this project, you will be presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. Your task is to analyse these examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style. 

You will present your reasoning for each example, record your presentation using Loom, and submit your findings along with the Loom recording to the Project Tab on the Learning Management System (LMS).
